![Customer Segmentation](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/4297/4297411.png)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and clustering techniques to identify distinct customer segments.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze customer data and use clustering algorithms to identify different segments of customers. This helps in understanding customer behavior and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer purchase history and various demographic and behavioral attributes.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning/2.%20Marketing%20and%20Customer%20Analysis/Customer%20Segmentation
    ```
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Customer_Segmentation.ipynb
    ```

## Key Steps
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
