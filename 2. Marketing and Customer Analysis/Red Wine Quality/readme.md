# Wine Quality Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of red wine quality. It aims to provide insights into the factors influencing wine quality and includes statistical analysis and data visualization. The analysis covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), summary statistics, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/jigsaw1313/data-analysis/blob/master/wine%20quality/winequality-red.csv). It includes features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, and wine quality ratings.

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy.stats
- statsmodels

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Import:** The dataset is loaded from the provided URL into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The following EDA steps are performed:
   - Feature distribution visualization.
   - Histograms and density plots for numerical features.
   - Correlation heatmap to explore feature relationships.

3. **Statistical Analysis:** This includes summary statistics, median statistics, mode statistics, and variance calculations for numerical features. Additionally, hypothesis tests (ANOVA) are conducted to assess the impact of fixed acidity, residual sugar, and pH on wine quality.

4. **Visualization:** Various visualizations are created to understand feature distributions and relationships, including histograms, box plots, count plots, and scatter plots.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-analysis.git

2. Install required libraries if not already installed:


3. Run the Jupyter notebook `redwine.ipynb` to explore the analysis in detail.
