## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze credit card transaction data and develop models to detect fraudulent transactions. The project includes steps for data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. It includes features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized variables.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning.git
    cd Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning/3.%20Risk%20Management%20and%20Financial%20Analysis/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb
    ```

2. Run through the cells to see data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize data distributions and relationships.
- **Model Training:** Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
