## Overview
The goal of this project is to classify customers on their probability of e-signing financial documents using machine learning techniques. The project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer information such as demographics, behavior, and previous interactions. It is used to predict whether a customer will e-sign financial documents.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning.git
    cd Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning/3.%20Risk%20Management%20and%20Financial%20Analysis/Customers_E_Signing_Classification
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook E_Signing_Of_Customer_Based_Financial.ipynb
    ```

2. Run through the cells to see data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize data distributions and relationships.
- **Model Training:** Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
