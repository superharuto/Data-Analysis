# Insurance Dataset Regression Analysis  

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to analyzing and predicting insurance costs using regression techniques. The dataset contains information such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region, enabling the prediction of medical insurance charges.

## Project Highlights  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Investigate the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable (insurance charges).  
   - Visualize key insights using plots and statistical summaries.  

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handle missing values.  
   - Encode categorical variables like `sex`, `smoker`, and `region`.  
   - Normalize numerical features such as `age` and `BMI` for better model performance.  

3. **Regression Modeling:**  
   - Implement multiple regression models to predict insurance costs.  
   - Compare model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ².  

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Interpret feature importance and understand the drivers of insurance costs.  
   - Validate the accuracy and generalization capability of the models.
