## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict house prices using machine learning regression techniques. The project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features related to houses, such as size, location, and amenities. It is used to predict the price of the houses.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning.git
    cd Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning/3.%20Risk%20Management%20and%20Financial%20Analysis/House%20Prices
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook House_Prices_Predictions_Regression_Model.ipynb
    ```

2. Run through the cells to see data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize data distributions and relationships.
- **Model Training:** Train regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
