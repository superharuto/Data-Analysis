# Online Retail Sales Clustering Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on clustering analysis of online retail sales data. The project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to identify distinct customer segments within an online retail sales dataset. By understanding these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is an online retail sales dataset, which includes information on transactions made by customers over a period of time. It contains details such as invoice number, stock code, description, quantity, invoice date, unit price, customer ID, and country.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning/1. Business Intelligence and Sales Analysis/Online Retail Sales (Clustering)
    ```
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Online_Retail_Sales_Cluestering_Model.ipynb
    ```

## Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting columns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating features such as total purchase amount, purchase frequency, and recency.
- **Clustering:** Applying clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluating the clustering results using metrics such as silhouette score and visualizing the clusters.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
