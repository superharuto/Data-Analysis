## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze factors contributing to employee attrition and build machine learning models to predict employee turnover. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features related to employees, such as age, job role, salary, and work environment, which are used to predict whether an employee will leave the company.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning.git
    cd Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning/6.%20Employment%20and%20Workforce/Employee%20Attrition
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Employee_Attrition.ipynb
    ```

2. Run through the cells to see data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize data distributions and relationships.
- **Model Training:** Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
