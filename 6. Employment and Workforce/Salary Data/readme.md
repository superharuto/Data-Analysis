# Salary Dataset Analysis and EDA

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Salary_Dataset_DataAnalysis_EDA.ipynb`) that explores the Salary Dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The notebook covers various aspects of data analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, and deriving insights from the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about salaries, including features such as age, gender, education level, job title, years of experience, and salary.

### Features:
- Age
- Gender
- Education Level
- Job Title
- Years of Experience
- Salary

## Analysis Overview
The notebook covers the following aspects of data analysis:

1. Data Import and Cleaning:
   - Importing the dataset from Google Drive.
   - Dropping null values.
   - Resolving inconsistencies in the 'Education Level' feature.
   - Checking for and removing duplicates.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualizing data distributions through histograms.
   - Analyzing the relationship between age, years of experience, and salary.
   - Identifying the most popular job titles and their corresponding salaries.
   - Examining the top salaries based on education level.
   - Investigating the effect of age and years of experience on salary.

3. Visualization:
   - Creating histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize relationships between different features.
   - Utilizing bar plots to compare salaries, ages, and years of experience based on gender.
