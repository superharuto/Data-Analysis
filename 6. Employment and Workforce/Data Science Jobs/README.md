# Title
Data Preprocessing with Python

# Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate data preprocessing techniques on a job listing dataset.

# Notebooks
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
This notebook (located at URL) takes an raw job listing CSV and performs the following:

* Handles missing values
* Removes duplicates
* Extracts and normalizes columns like Salary, Location, etc.
* Saves cleaned data

2. Data Encoding and Scaling
This notebook (located at URL) loads the cleaned data and:

* Encodes categorical variables
* Scales numeric variables
* Saves encoded/scaled data

# Requirements
* Python 3.x  
* Pandas  
* NumPy  
* Scikit-learn  

# Usage
The notebooks can be run directly on Google Colab or the code can be reused on other datasets.

# Contributing
Fork and improve! Pull requests are welcome.
