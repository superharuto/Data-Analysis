# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set By UCI Machine Learning

This repository contains an analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data set, which includes machine learning and data analysis techniques. The project is organized as follows:

## Contents
- `Breast_Cancer.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook detailing the data analysis and machine learning workflow.
- Data pre-processing and visualization steps.
- Feature engineering and selection.
- Model training and evaluation.

## Getting Started
To run the notebook, clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning.git
cd Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning/4. Public Health and Safety/Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which is publicly available and contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Results
The notebook includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare model performances.
