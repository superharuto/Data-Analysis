![Water Quality](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/1048/1048946.png)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on analyzing and classifying water quality. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of machine learning algorithms to predict water quality based on various parameters.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze water quality data and classify the samples into different quality categories. This analysis can help in identifying water sources that meet safety standards and those that require further treatment.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features representing different chemical properties and contaminants present in water samples. The target variable indicates the quality of water, which can be classified into different categories.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning/4.%20Public%20Health%20and%20Safety/Water%20Quality
