# Weather Data Clustering

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that focuses on clustering weather data to identify patterns and trends. The project uses machine learning techniques to cluster weather conditions and gain insights into different weather patterns.

## Overview
The objective of this project is to perform clustering on a weather dataset to group similar weather conditions together. By clustering the data, we can better understand the different weather patterns and their characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of weather data, including parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The dataset can be accessed from various weather data sources or public datasets available online.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning/4. Public Health and Safety/Weather Data Clustering
    ```
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Weather_Data_Clustering.ipynb
    ```

## Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the weather data by handling missing values, normalizing data, and selecting relevant features.
- **Clustering Techniques:** Applying clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering to group similar weather conditions.
- **Visualization:** Visualizing the clustered data using various plots to interpret the clustering results and understand the different weather patterns.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Results
The project results in clustered groups of weather conditions, which can be visualized and interpreted to understand different weather patterns. The clustering results help in identifying similar weather conditions and their characteristics.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of clustering techniques on weather data to identify patterns and trends. The insights gained from this analysis can help in better understanding weather conditions and making informed decisions based on weather patterns.
