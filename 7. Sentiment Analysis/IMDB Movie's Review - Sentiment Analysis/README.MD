# IMDB Movies Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews. The project aims to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using various machine learning techniques.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict the sentiment of a movie review. By analyzing the sentiments, we can understand the overall perception of movies and derive insights for improving content or marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IMDB movie reviews dataset, which includes 50,000 reviews labeled as positive or negative. The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning/7. Sentiment Analysis/IMDB Movie's Review - Sentiment Analysis
    ```
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook IMDB_Movies_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and applying tokenization.
- **Feature Extraction:** Converting text data into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF.
- **Model Building:** Applying machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Results
The project results in a trained sentiment analysis model that can classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis. The insights gained from this analysis can help in understanding audience sentiment and improving movie-related decisions.
