# Flight Delay Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project focusing on flight delays. The dataset includes information about 336,776 flights in the year 2013, covering various features such as departure time, departure delay, arrival time, carrier, origin, destination, and more.

## Project Structure
- **Data Analysis Notebook:** The Jupyter Notebook (`Flights.ipynb`) includes the entire data analysis process.
- **Dataset:** The dataset (`flights.csv`) used for the analysis.


## Analysis Highlights
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of flight delays.
- Relationship analysis between features and arrival delays.
- Visualization of insights using various plots (histograms, scatter plots, violin plots, and correlation heatmap).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jigsaw1313/Data-Analysis
   cd flight-delay-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies (assuming you have Python and pip installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install seaborn
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
